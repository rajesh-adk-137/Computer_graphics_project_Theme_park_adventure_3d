# OpenGL Theme Park Simulation

This project is a simple theme park simulation developed using OpenGL, created with the Visual Studio IDE on Windows. It aims to showcase the basics of OpenGL graphics and how it can be used to create a virtual theme park environment with dynamic rides and lighting effects.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Visual Studio IDE (Windows)
- FreeGLUT library
- OpenGL library

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio IDE.
3. Make sure you have FreeGLUT and OpenGL libraries properly configured.
4. Build and run the project from within Visual Studio.

## Features

- Virtual theme park simulation.
- Basic rides like a Ferris wheel, Nepali-style swing, and round swing.
- Dynamic lighting and ambient illumination effects.
- Demonstrates the fundamental use of OpenGL for graphics rendering.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/theme-park-simulation.git`
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Configure the FreeGLUT and OpenGL libraries if necessary.
4. Build and run the project to experience the theme park simulation.

## License

Feel free to use it anyway you like.

## Acknowledgements
