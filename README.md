# 🎢 OpenGL Theme Park Simulation

A simple virtual **theme park simulation** developed using **OpenGL** and **FreeGLUT**, created in **Visual Studio (Windows)**. This project showcases fundamental OpenGL techniques to simulate dynamic rides, lighting effects, and 3D interaction.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

To build and run this project, you’ll need:

- **Visual Studio** (2017 or newer)
- **OpenGL** (Included with most compilers)
- **FreeGLUT** (For window management and input handling)

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

setting up opengl with freeglut in visual studio can be frustrating for first-time users. It is highly recommended to follow
step-by-step tutorials on **YouTube** or other trusted sources to correctly configure include paths, linker settings, and dependencies.

Once setup is done:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/theme-park-simulation.git
    ```
2. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project (`Ctrl + Shift + B`) and run it (`F5`).
